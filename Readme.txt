路  Processed data with data engineering, visualized data, predicted user churn with machine learning methods and evaluated the result.
路  Visualized data distribution and correlation by Seaborn, and cleaned features according to the correlation.
路  Trained supervised machine learning models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, applied regularization term to overcome overfitting, and chose proper loss function optimization function to speed up degradation. Predicted user churn and evaluated the result by mean accuracy.
路  Tuned optimal hyperparameters by Grid Search, and Evaluated models by ROC and AUC.
